~ temporal coupling
situation: within the same scope, create an IRI, but later on a same-named variable
(only possible if IRI is still in cache)
options: 
	raise a warning / error
	from that point onward, consider this name as a var (formula-wide, lexicographic)
	re-visit all prior same-named nodes and set their internal node as the defined var (formula-wide)
	
	
situation: within the same scope, create a var, but later on a same-named IRI
options: 
	raise a warning / error
	set internal node of IRI as the previously defined var (lexicographic, formula-wide)
	
	
situation: within the same scope, create a variable, but then create another variable with different quantification
options: 
	raise a warning / error
	from that point onward, the var will have the new quantification
